# 0x01. Shell Permissions

In this project, I learned about Linux file permissions and how to use commands: `chmod`, sudo`, `su`, `chown`, `chgrp`, and more.

## Tasks
- **_0. My name is Betty_**
	- [0-iam_betty](./0-iam_betty): Bash script that switches the current user to the user `betty`

- **_1. Who am I_**
	- [1-who_am_i](./1-who_am_i): Bash script that prints the effective username of the current user.

# System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD

This repository contains programs I've written for the system engineering and DevOps track at ALX SE. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing bash scripts to automate tasks. The specific list of projects is as follows:

- [0x00. Shell, basics](./0x00-shell_basics)
- [0x01. Shell, permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)
- [0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters](./0x02-shell_redirections)

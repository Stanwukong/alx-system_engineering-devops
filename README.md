# System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD

This repository contains programs I've written for the system engineering and DevOps track at ALX SE. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing bash scripts to automate tasks. The specific list of projects is as follows:

- [0x00. Shell, basics](./0x00-shell_basics)
- [0x01. Shell, permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)
- [0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters](./0x02-shell_redirections)
- [0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions](./0x03-shell_variables_expansions)
- [0x05. Processes and signals](./0x05-processes_and_signals)
- [0x06. Regular expression](./0x06-regular_expressions)
- [0x07. Networking basics #0](./0x07-networking_basics)
- [0x08. Networking basics #1](./0x08-networking_basics_2)
- [0x0A. Configuration management](./0x0A-configuration_management)
- [0x0B. SSH](./0x0B-ssh)
- [Attack is the best defense](./attack_is_the_best_defense)

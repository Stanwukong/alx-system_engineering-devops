# Shell basics

This project took me on an introductory crash course in the Shell. I learned how to navigate directories using `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, how to look around using `ls`, `less`, and `file`, and how to manipulate files with `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and how to create directories with `mkdir`. I also practiced working with the `type`, `whch`, `help`, and `man` commands, implementing wildcards, reading man pages, creating links with `ln`, and using keyboard shortcuts in Bash.

## Tasks

- **_0. Where am I?_**
	- [0-current_working_directory](./0-current_working_directory): Bash script that prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory.

- **_1. What's in there?_**
	- [1-listit](./1-listit): Bash script that displays the content list of the current directory.

- **_2. There is no place like home_**
	- [2-bring_me_home](./2-bring_me_home): Bash script that changes the working directory to the user's home directory.
